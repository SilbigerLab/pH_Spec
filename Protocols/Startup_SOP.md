1. Plate reader is connected but unresponsive through SoftMax Pro
    1. The lab computer is fairly slow, so be patient with it and try to not task overload.
    1. If the instrument is still unresponsive through the program after you've waited for possibly just slow task completion, try exiting the program and reopening.
    1. If the program will not let you exit because it says the instrument is running, go to the plate reader's touch screen and press "Disconnect".  Wait a moment (up to about a minute) on SoftMax Pro before attempting to reconnect to the instrument.
