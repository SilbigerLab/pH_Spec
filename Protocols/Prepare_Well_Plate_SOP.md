1. When handling well plates, be careful to not touch the bottom of the plate with bare hands/gloves or place the plate on any surface that may scratch it.  For absorbance readings, light is projected through the bottom of the plate and any disturbed surface will likely affect the reading.  Place on kim wipes when set down, and hold by the sides when carrying/handling.
1. Each well has a maximum volume of 340uL, but it is advisable to not greatly exceed 300uL, especially if shaking before your read.

1. Refer to your plate template on the SMP7 software to make sure you pipette your samples into their designated wells.
1. Place your sample vials in a water bath at the desired temperature (e.g., 25degC)
1. Once your samples and the spec are at temperature, use a 1000uL pipette with a new tip per sample (use the same tip for each set of replicates) to pipette **300uL** of sample into each well of a clean well plate (no scratches or smudges on the bottom of the plate).
  1. Be quick so your sample does not shift from the desired temperature (if your ambient room temperature is not the same)
1. Immediately place your well plate into the Spec on the reader tray and run your samples.

<a name="adding_m_cresol"></a> **Adding m-cresol**

1. Safety Precautions
  1. Always wear gloves when handling m-cresol and other potentially harmful substances.
  1. Keep chemicals sealed and properly stored in the fume hood when not in use.
  1. Always dispose of solid and liquid waste properly in labeled containers.
1. If you need to add m-cresol to your well plate after a first run through teh Spec, use a 10uL pipette to pipette **5uL** of m-cresol into each well.
  1. Be quick so your sample does not shift from the desired temperature, but also be careful to maintain precision amongst your wells. 
1. Immediately place your well plate into the Spec on the reader tray and run your samples again, saving them to a new plate ([in SMP7](Plate_Read_Setup_SOP.md))

<a name="cleaning_and_storage"></a> **Cleaning and storage**

1. Once finished with the plate, use DI water to rinse out the wells, and dispose of both the initial contents and the rinse solution as needed per the contents' waste procedures.
  1. If using any solutions with Mercuric Chloride (HgCl2) use the large beaker labeled "HgCl2" to dump the contents and into which to rinse with DI.  Pour these contents from the beaker into a proper waste container.
  1. Note that liquid waste with m-cresol should be stored separately from liquid waste without m-cresol (ex. one waste container for HgCl2 waste, and one for m-cresol and/or m-cresol with HgCl2 waste)
1. Let the plate dry on kim wipes and covered on top by kim wipes, and/or use only kim wipes to wipe away any remaining DI water, again being careful to not disturb (smudge or scratch) the bottom surface of the plate.
