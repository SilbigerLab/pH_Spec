# Protocol for preparing a well plate to use with the SpectraMax iD3 Spectrophotometer

**Preparing the well plate**  

1. When handling well plates, be careful to not touch the bottom of the plate with bare hands/gloves or place the plate on any surface that may scratch it.  For absorbance readings, light is projected through the bottom of the plate and any disturbed surface will likely affect the reading.  Place on kim wipes when set down, and hold by the sides when carrying/handling.
1. Each well has a maximum volume of 340uL, but it is advisable to not greatly exceed 300uL, especially if shaking before your read.
1. Once finished with the plate, use DI water to rinse out the wells, and dispose of both the initial contents and the rinse solution as needed per the contents' waste procedures.
    1. If using any solutions with Mercuric Chloride (HgCL2) use the large beaker labeled "HgCl2" to dump the contents and into which to rinse with DI.  Pour these contents from the beaker into a proper waste container.
    1. Note that liquid waste with m-cresol should be stored separately from liquid waste without m-cresol (ex. one waste container for HgCl2 waste, and one for m-cresol and/or m-cresol with HgCl2 waste)
1. Let the plate dry on kim wipes and covered on top by kim wipes, and/or use only kim wipes to wipe away any remaining DI water, again being careful to not disturb (smudge or scratch) the bottom surface of the plate.
